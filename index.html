      Our use of the seven-day week can be traced back to the astronomically 
      gifted Babylonians and the decree of King Sargon I of Akkad around 2300 BCE.
      They venerated the number seven, and before telescopes the key celestial 
      bodies numbered seven (the Sun, the Moon and the five planets visible to the 
      naked eye).
      The seven-day week is also closely linked to Judaism and the story of Genesis, 
      with God resting on the seventh day.
